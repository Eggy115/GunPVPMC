# GunPVPMC
These are the full original skripts from GunPVPMC. When I say original, I obviously don't mean from 2020. But the ones that I used in the 2024/25 revival. The only modifications I have made are to `bot.sk` which has had the token removed. Other than that, there are no changes. Bugs and exploits and all.
## Things of Note
- The `old` folder is what remains from 2022, and what I used to start it up again from 2025. So, theoretically, you could go through and compare `old` vs everything else, and see what I added and changed and removed and so on.
- `coldest.py` is a python script which I wrote the day before I quit GunPVPMC, so I never had a chance to use it, but it is basically a really quick and easy method of making guns, without having to copy and paste all the code and would have massively improved efficiency
- `todolist.txt` is the actual to-dolist I used, rather than the public one in #upcoming on the Discord
